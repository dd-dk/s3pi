# Matching is done top to bottom
#

#
# Matching is done against "Wrapper" (matches the name of the wrapper used for the resource;
# "DefaultResource" is the wrapper used when no other one is identified)
# and against index entry values (e.g. "ResourceType").
# In both cases "*" can be used to mean "any".
#

# "{}" is replaced with the filename when on Editor/Viewer or ...Arguments lines
# "{prop}" is replaced with the selected resource's "prop" field value on ...Argument lines

# Note: if you are passing a file to your editor and it does not update the write timestamp,
# use "group.EditorIgnoreWriteTimestamp: anything_here".

# To group matching criteria with their actions, prefix the criteria and actions with the same value
# (here we use "txt", "img", "dds" and "any").
