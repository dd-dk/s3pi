# Comments start with "#", "//" or ";" anywhere on the line
# Block comments /* */ are allowed, too.

# Matching is done against "Wrapper" (matches the name of the wrapper used for the resource;
# "DefaultResource" is the wrapper used when no other one is identified)
# and against IResourceKey values (e.g. "ResourceType").
# In both cases "*" can be used to mean "any".
#

# You can specify a description with "Desc: text"

# You can specify the label for the button with "Label: labeltext"

# The command to run is specified with "Command: exename" (with path, if needed)
# (Note that the folder containing the config file is included in the OS search path)

# Any required arguments are specified with "Arguments: args"
# {} is replaced with the filename when on Command or Arguments lines
# {prop} is replaced with the selected resource's "prop" field value on Argument line
# Note: you probably want to add quotes around {} and {prop} - this isn't automatic

# To flag a command as read-only (preventing any updates to the package), use "ReadOnly: anything_here"
# Note: if you are passing a file to your editor and it does not update the write timestamp,
# use "IgnoreWriteTimestamp: anything_here".

// Here are some other examples - you would only have one per file
// --

// Could try just running it... but we won't; the uses the OS's file associations
;Wrapper: *
;Desc: Just run it
;Label: Start
;Command: {}
// To avoid ever saving updates, say the helper is read-only
;ReadOnly: yes

// Or you might want to use Notepad on everything not handled above
;Wrapper: *
;Desc: Try Notepad
;Label: Edit
;Command: notepad
;Arguments: "{}"

// If you have an editor that doesn't update file timestamps on save, call it like this:
;ResourceType: 0xFEEDF00D
;Desc: Super feedf00d editor
;Label: Edit
;Command: X:\Path\To\Editor.exe
;Arguments: "{}"
;IgnoreWriteTimestamp: whatever

; png
;Wrapper: ImageResource
// This is where GIMP installs by default:
