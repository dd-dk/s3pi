# s3pi
"Sims 3 Package Interface" provides a core library of portable code that "understands" Sims3 game packages. Note that (with some minor tweaks) the core library code also understands other game package formats (e.g. SimCity Online, Sims4).

Along with the core library are a number of "wrappers" that provide the main part of the project. These handle deserialization and serialization of data within the package (or any other source).

Further tools (not supplied here) can use the core library and wrappers to manipulate the data content of package files.

Imported from http://sourceforge.net/projects/s3pi/, because SVN, and SF in particular, is garbage.
Official development on this project by pljones have ended, and as of right now, I don't have any plans to continue it.
